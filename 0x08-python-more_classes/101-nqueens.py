"""
This module contains a program that solves the N queens problem.

The N queens problem is the challenge of placing
N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

The program takes one command line argument, which is the number of queens N.
The program prints every possible solution to the problem, one per line,
in the format of a list of coordinates.
The program also checks the validity of the input and raises
appropriate exceptions if necessary.
